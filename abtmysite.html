      <h1>SITE IMPROVEMENTS</h1>
      <h5>
        This page gives reflection about what I have learnt while designing my
        site.
      </h5>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      I have learnt a lot while building this site. Though this journey I have
      gained knowledge about many elements in designing a website <br />
      Elements such as video audio interactions in website. Importance of having
      a seperate CSS and a common CSS. Useage of hover elements and many more.
      <br /><br /><br /><br />I picked up few elements through the teaching
      process of the course which if i was aware of them before I would have
      change the way i approced things in this website. They are: The click
      hover in the nav bar does't reflect which page the user is in. and its
      important to have it as it helps user keep track of what pages he/she is
      in. The click hover in the nav bar does't reflect the change in colour of
      text with the pages that have already been visited by the user. This also
      help the user krrp track on the webpages.<br />
      I would have gone through validation rules prior to the start of my
      website so that this would be a problem at the end atleast it would avoid
      me having 50-60 errors per page to be corrected.
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      Upon the completion this assignment i am now more confident on my
      desinging as well as my coding skills in HTML and CSS than at the begining
      of this assignment. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      Thanks to my tutors and TOM for helping me come across all this way.
