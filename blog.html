      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        At age 17 I had few issues which lead me into drepression and loss of
        confidence. It was so severe that i wanted to stop my education forever.
        I had no serious goals set for the future. I was wage on what I wanted
        to do with my life. And this was not onlt panicking me up but also
        taking my drepression into a severe condition. I still remember that day
        when i locked myself up in a room. Not wanting to see people nor wanting
        speak to them. My Parents were petrifed as well.<br /><br /><br />
        My mum then started taking me to yoga classes. I was reluctant, like
        anyother 17year old I reffused to go. A week passed and then another. I
        slowly realized yoga and meditation were helping me cope up with my
        situation, I was better, my thoughts were more clear, I realized its
        okay not to have future thoughts or goals but its better though. Yoga
        gave me the power to see life from a different perpective and challenge
        things that come up rather than shutting them down and ignoring to face
        them. I got back a pro version of myself, much more happier, confident
        and stronger.

      <h1>My Passion</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        My Passion derives from my story. I did yoga continuously for 6 months
        then and saw a huge positive change both physically and mentally. I have
        taken "Bachelor of science in yoga" as a distance education apart from
        my "Bachelor of Computer science". I graduated from both successfully
        and hence I have decided to make yoga as my passion (thats one of the
        things that I would love to do) into small partime that would help me as
        well as others grow and help them get through some tough times. I
        thought yoga to many children and adults untill I came to pursue my
        master abroad.
