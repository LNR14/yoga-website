      <h1>What is yoga?</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Yoga is the perfect control of mind and consciousness at a level with
        perfection in it. It is universal, no bound by dogmas and beliefs of any
        particular religion. Thus it is available to all irrespective of any
        limitations such as sex, natinality, age, etc. Yoga is a complete
        freedom from misery. Yoga is very old, well-tested scientific system of
        training human organisum in all its aspects-body, mind and sprit to
        bring into the highest possible integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoga is well-known to touch and influence all the aspects of human life
        and activity. The practice of yoga prevents psychosomatic
        disorders/diseases and improves and individuals resistance and ability
        to endure stressful situations. Yoga is a very ancient science. It is
        thousands of years old. The perceptions derived from its practice form
        the backbone of the greatness of India, Which for centuries has been
        legendary. The truths espoused in the yoga teachings, however, are not
        limited to India, nor to those who consciously practice yoga techniques.
